A **continual** collection of papers related to Text-guided 3D Visual Grounding (T-3DVG).

Text-guided 3D visual grounding (T-3DVG) aims to locate a specific object that semantically corresponds to a language query from a complicated 3D scene, has drawn increasing attention in the 3D research community over the past few years.
T-3DVG presents great potential and challenges due to its closer proximity to the real world and the complexity of data collection and 3D point cloud source processing.

In the T-3DVG community, we've summarized existing T-3DVG methods in our survey paper👍.
